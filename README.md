# NeuralWalker

The code implements the neural encoder-aligner-decoder model for direction following task, described in paper "Listen, Attend, and Walk: Neural Mapping of Navigational Instructions to Action Sequences". (Press the link http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.04089)

The code is under final-testing and will show up soon...
